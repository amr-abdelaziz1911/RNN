## Objectives:
The objective of this project is to build an image captioning system that generates textual descriptions for images using a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Transfer Learning with the VGG16 model.

## Dataset:
Images: A collection of .jpg images provided in a dataset.
Captions: Text descriptions corresponding to each image, stored in a captions.txt file.

## Dependencies:
The following libraries and tools are required for running this project:

-TensorFlow (Keras for deep learning)
-NumPy
-Scikit-learn
-Pillow (PIL for image processing)
-Matplotlib (for plotting results)
-NLTK (for BLEU score evaluation)
-OpenCV (for real-time captioning)
-Pickle (for saving and loading models and features)
Ensure all dependencies are installed before proceeding. This code has been tested in Python 3.8+.

Steps to Run the Code:
-Step 1: Clone the Repository and Extract the Dataset
Download the project files.
Click the Code button in the repository.
Select Download ZIP.
Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your local machine.
-Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
Ensure Python 3.8+ and the required libraries are installed. Use pip install -r requirements.txt if a requirements.txt file is provided.
Place the dataset ZIP file (archive.zip) in the project folder.
-Step 3: Prepare the Dataset
Extract the dataset:
with zipfile.ZipFile("archive.zip", "r") as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("./dataset")
Ensure the dataset structure is as follows:
./dataset
├── images/
└── captions.txt
-Step 4: Preprocess the Data
Load and preprocess captions using the provided load_captions and preprocess_captions functions.
Extract image features using the VGG16 model and save the extracted features for later use:
with open("vgg_features.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(features_dict, f)
-Step 5: Train the RNN Model
Split the data into training and validation sets.
Train the RNN model using the model.fit() method.
Monitor the training process and use early stopping to avoid overfitting.
-Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model's performance using BLEU scores:
bleu_score_1, bleu_score_2 = evaluate_bleu(model, tokenizer, test_ids, captions_dict, features_dict, max_length)
Plot the training and validation loss/accuracy curves.
-Step 7: Convert Model for Deployment
Convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile and edge deployment:
tflite_model = converter.convert()
with open("model.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
-Step 8: Real-Time Captioning
Use a webcam feed for real-time image captioning.
Display the generated captions on the video feed using OpenCV.
-Step 9: Visualize Results
Display image samples with their generated captions:
show_png_images("sample.png")
Sample Outputs:
The model generates captions like:
"A person riding a horse on a beach"
"A dog playing with a ball in the park"
Notes:
Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., embedding_dim, lstm_units, learning_rate) as needed for improved performance.
Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled for faster training and inference.

The VGG16 model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
BLEU score evaluation is based on NLTK's implementation.
